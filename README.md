# Dapper Overview

- **Dapper Integration**: Dapper enhances `.NET` applications by extending the `IDbConnection` interface, simplifying the process of querying and executing commands on the database.

    ```csharp
    // Example of Dapper extending IDbConnection
    var users = dbConnection.Query<User>("SELECT * FROM Users");
    ```

- **Performance**: Dapper stands out for its speed, adding minimal overhead to database operations, which positions it among the fastest ORM tools available.

    ```plaintext
    Dapper's performance is optimized for speed, ensuring quick data access and manipulation.
    ```

- **Ease of Use**: Dapper allows for straightforward mapping of query results to strongly typed lists or objects, streamlining the data access layer with just a few lines of code.

    ```csharp
    // Mapping query result to a strongly typed list
    List<User> users = connection.Query<User>("SELECT * FROM Users").ToList();
    ```

- **Flexibility**: It supports a wide range of database operations, including parameterized queries, stored procedures, and dynamic mapping, offering developers versatility in data handling.

    ```csharp
    // Using a parameterized query to fetch user details
    var user = connection.QueryFirstOrDefault<User>("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Id = @Id", new { Id = userId });
    ```

- **Micro-ORM**: Unlike full-fledged ORMs, Dapper is a micro-ORM that encourages working directly with SQL, providing developers with complete control over database interactions.

    ```plaintext
    Dapper's approach as a micro-ORM allows for direct SQL interaction, giving developers greater control over database queries and operations.
    ```
